# Player Design: Aeroblade Drone

In "Aeroblade: Shadows of the Nexus", players control a futuristic drone, which serves as the main player character. Let's delve deeper into the design elements associated with the drone:

## 1. Player Appearance, Movements, and Actions

### **Appearance**:
- The drone, being from the year 2300, sports a sleek, aerodynamic design.
- It boasts a metallic finish, reflecting the advanced materials of its era, illuminated by neon accents.
- The underbelly houses weapon systems that are subtly hidden but can engage quickly when needed.

### **Movements**:
- **Flight**: The drone can hover, ascend, descend, strafe, and make rapid directional changes.
- **Evade**: The drone can quickly dodge in any direction to avoid incoming attacks.
- **Stabilize**: Post-evading, the drone can quickly stabilize itself to re-engage.

### **Actions**:
- **Scan**: The drone can scan its surroundings to identify threats, objectives, or points of interest.
- **Interact**: The drone can engage with specific tech nodes or access points in the environment, whether to gather information, hack, or perform other contextual actions.

## 2. Weapon System & Upgrades

### **Base Weapons**:
- **Pulse Blaster**: A ranged weapon with rapid-fire capability but lower damage.
- **Plasma Cannon**: A high damage, slow rate of fire weapon, which requires a "mana-like" attribute for its usage.

### **Weapon Upgrades**:
- **Enhanced Ammunition**: Increase damage or add elemental effects.
- **Range Boosters**: Extend the effective range of weapons.
- **Stabilizers**: Reduce recoil, improving accuracy.

### **MVP (Minimal Viable Product)**:
For the game's initial stages, the drone will have just the Pulse Blaster, with a simple upgrade mechanism allowing for increased damage. As the game progresses, more advanced upgrade options can be incorporated.

## 3. Fighting Mechanics

### **Locking Targets**:
- The drone can lock onto targets, ensuring that its weapon systems and camera stay focused on the enemy.
- Multiple targets can be cycled through using directional controls.

### **Combat**:
- **Ranged Attacks**: Utilize the drone's weapons to attack from a distance.
- **Parry Mechanism**: With perfect timing, the drone can deflect incoming ranged attacks using a protective energy shield.
- **Combo System**: Chain together attacks for increased damage output.
