# **Game Mechanics for Aeroblade: Shadows of the Nexus**

## **1. Drone Movement and Navigation**:

### **1.1. Basic Movement**:
- The drone is capable of **360-degree movement** in all directions.
- Maneuvers include **forward acceleration**, **backward deceleration**, **strafing left/right**, **ascending** and **descending**.

### **1.2. Evade Movement**:
- Quick dodge-like maneuver allowing the drone to swiftly move in a direction to avoid an attack.
- Has a **short cooldown** to prevent spamming.

## **2. Combat Mechanics**:

### **2.1. Laser Blaster (Primary Weapon)**:
- **Linear Damage Reduction**: Continuous use reduces damage linearly to a minimum threshold.
- **Damage Regeneration**: Damage output regenerates upon pausing or reducing the firing rate.

### **2.2. Plasma Cannon (Secondary Weapon)**:
- **Charge Mechanic**: Can be charged for a more powerful shot with larger blast radius.
- **Skill-based Timing**: Release at the right moment during enemy's vulnerability for maximum effect.
- **Recoil**: Causes slight disorientation to the drone post-fire.

### **2.3. Defense Mechanisms**:

#### **2.3.1. Shield Parry**:
- Parrying at the correct moment boosts mana and can counter-attack.
- Shield has limited power which reduces upon blocking; if power reaches zero, it's temporarily unusable.
- Power regenerates over time or with specific items/skills.

#### **2.3.2. Evade**:
- Swift dodge with a cooldown.

### **2.4. Targeting System**:
- Lock-on system aids in aiming and highlights enemy attack or vulnerability cues.

## **3. Progression and Upgrades**:
- Players can **upgrade** and **customize** their drone's capabilities at bases.
- Upgrades can be obtained through in-game currency or by completing specific challenges/missions.

## **4. Mission Structure**:
- The game comprises various missions or chapters aiming at controlling strategic points.
- Some missions involve combating malevolent AI, while others might be recon or resource collection.

## **5. Base Operations**:
- Players have a **home base** for major upgrades, respawn, and strategizing.
- Capture other bases to establish additional respawn points and unlock further areas or missions.

## **6. Interstellar Travel**:
- Utilize wormholes at bases for faster travel to distant missions, reducing latency and aiding in real-time drone control.

## Parry Mechanics

### Visual Cues for Parry-able Attacks
- **Color Coding**: Attacks that can be parried might have a specific color, such as a green or blue hue, while unparry-able attacks could be indicated by a red hue.
- **Weapon/Projectile Glow**: Weapons or projectiles might glow or pulsate when they're about to launch a parry-able attack.

### Benefits of Successful Parry
- **Mana Regeneration**: A successful parry results in a boost to the drone's mana, which is essential for using the heavy "Plasma Cannon".
- **Counter-Attack Opportunity**: Following a successful parry, there's a short window where enemies are vulnerable, allowing the drone to counter-attack with increased damage.

### Risks of Unsuccessful Parry
- **Stagger**: Failing to time the parry right can leave the drone staggered, making it vulnerable for a short duration.
- **Mana Depletion**: A missed parry might also result in a small reduction in mana as a penalty.

## Evade Mechanics

### Visual Cues for Unparry-able Attacks
- **Unique Animations**: Enemies can have a distinct animation or wind-up before launching an unparry-able attack, alerting the player.
- **Audio Alerts**: A specific sound effect or enemy shout can signal an incoming unparry-able attack.

### Evade Benefits
- **Safety**: Successfully evading an attack ensures the drone takes no damage.
- **Positioning**: A well-timed evade can position the drone advantageously for a counter-attack or retreat.

### Timing
- While the window for a successful parry is narrow, evading has a slightly more generous timeframe, making it a safer but less rewarding option in many scenarios.

## Integration of Both Mechanics
- **Learning Curve**: Early game levels should introduce both mechanics separately, with clear visual cues. This trains players to recognize which defense move to use.
- **Skill Testing**: As the game progresses, attacks can become more rapid and less predictable, testing the player's reflexes and decision-making skills.
- **Enemy Variety**: Different enemies can specialize in different attack types. Some might primarily use parry-able ranged attacks, while others focus on unparry-able melee strikes.
- **Environment Dynamics**: In certain environments, the ability to parry or evade might be hindered, adding another layer of strategy.
