# Month 1: Initial Setup & Foundation

## Objectives
- Set up the development environment.
- Lay the foundation for "Aeroblade: Shadows of the Nexus."
- Begin prototyping basic drone mechanics.

## Week 1: Setup and Initialization

### Tasks

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Setup github and codespaces with starting documentation. Explore Chat GPT.
   - Configure Unity for the project.
   - Set up the initial project structure and directories in Unity.
   - Integrate Unity with the GitHub repository.

2. **Documentation Review**:
   - Ensure all previously discussed documentation (Plot, Development Plan, README) is available and organized in the GitHub repo.
   - Create any additional documentation as needed.

3. **Asset Gathering**:
   - Start gathering or creating placeholder assets for the drone, environments, and any initial NPCs or obstacles.

## Week 2: Basic Drone Mechanics - Part I

### Tasks

1. **Drone Movement**:
   - Implement basic flight mechanics for the drone.
   - Allow for forward/backward movement, strafing, ascending, and descending.
   
2. **Camera Controls**:
   - Design a camera system that follows the drone effectively, providing the player with a clear view of the surroundings and any potential threats or objectives.

3. **Initial Playtesting**:
   - Continually test and refine the basic movement mechanics to ensure they feel intuitive and responsive.

## Week 3: Basic Drone Mechanics - Part II

### Tasks

1. **Combat Prototyping**:
   - Implement a basic ranged attack for the drone, using the gun-like weapon described earlier.
   - Design a recoil and reload system.
   
2. **Defensive Mechanics**:
   - Start working on the parry mechanic, allowing the drone to deflect or block incoming attacks.
   - Incorporate the "mana-like" attribute that will enhance certain attacks.

3. **Upgrade System Initiation**:
   - Design the initial framework for upgrading the drone, ensuring it's modular to accommodate future enhancements and technologies.

## Week 4: Level Design & Feedback

### Tasks

1. **Initial Level Creation**:
   - Design a basic level or environment that allows players to test out the drone's movement and combat mechanics.
   - Incorporate obstacles, enemies, or targets to interact with.
   
2. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Spend time playing through the level, noting areas of improvement, bugs, or any elements that feel off.
   - Gather feedback from trusted colleagues or friends to gain an external perspective.

3. **Iteration**:
   - Implement changes based on the feedback received.

4. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update all documentation with the progress made this month.
   - Set preliminary goals for month 2.
